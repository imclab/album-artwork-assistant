<h1>Version 1.9</h1>

<ul>
	<li>The image browser scrolls to the top after each a search, assuming that you always prefer the top results.</li>
	<li>Image downloads time out after 5 seconds. You can control this in the preferences.</li>
</ul>

<a name="version-1.8"></a>
<h1>Version 1.8</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Album Artwork Assistant now switches to iTunes after adding an item to the batch queue (and
	there is a new preference to control this).<br/>
	The assumption is that if you use the queue, you’re most likely switching back and forth between iTunes and Album Artwork Assistant
	and so the program might as well do it for you.<br/>
	If you use this in combination with
	the iTunes keyboard shortcut (as described in the application help), you won’t have to switch programs at all.</li>
</ul>
