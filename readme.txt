Album Artwork Assistant embeds album cover artwork from Google Images and Amazon into your iTunes music files.

It integrates closely with iTunes, for getting the currently selected album track data as well as for embedding the images in the tracks.

Because embedding is a lengthy process, the application features a queue that lets the user search for the artwork for many albums and then process them all together without supervision.
